**Restaurant Ordering System**
An interactive, single-page restaurant ordering system developed for PEARL INSTITUTE, Batala. This project is designed to provide a simple and user-friendly interface for ordering food items. Users can browse the menu, add items to their order, adjust quantities, view the total cost in real-time, and place their order.

**Project Overview**
This project was created to demonstrate basic web development skills using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It serves as a model for implementing a simple yet effective restaurant ordering system with an attractive user interface and essential ordering functionality.


**Features**
Responsive Design: The application uses a two-column layout, ensuring it looks great on all screen sizes.
Dynamic Menu: Displays a list of Indian food items with prices in rupees (₹). Each item includes an "Add to Order" button.
Order Summary: The selected items appear in the order summary section, where users can:
Increase or decrease the quantity of each item.
Remove individual items.
View the total price, updated in real-time.
Prevent Duplicates: Adding an item multiple times increases its quantity rather than duplicating it.
Place Order Confirmation: A "Place Order" button allows users to finalize their order, showing a confirmation message and resetting the list.

Bootstrap: For responsive layout and consistent design components.
JavaScript: For handling dynamic interactions, including the order summary updates and real-time total calculation.
